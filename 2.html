<strong>In order to play Valorant,<br> you must first know what kind of role it is.</strong>
<p style="margin-top:15px;"</p><strong>1.You will benefit from fighting using firepower and mobility at medium and close range, and inducing melee situations by using skills that can deceive the enemy even for a short time.</strong>
<br><p style="margin-top:10px;"</p><strong>2.Agents belonging to the strategist have at least one smoke screen skill that blocks the enemy's vision by default. These sight-obstructing skills have a longer duration or range than similar skills of other agents, and can be installed from a little further away, so they can be strategically used in both offense and defense. It also plays a big role in achieving victory conditions outside of aim fights, such as installing or removing spikes so that the enemy cannot see them by using the long duration of the skill that blocks the sight.</strong>
